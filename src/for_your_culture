We should use the full path starting at src/ for our include directories

I dont like looking at .. lmao

Lets say our file looks like the following:
	(x.cc)
	#include "src/x/x.h"
	#include "src/y/y.h"

To compile this thing, make sure to use the -I flag for gcc (since x.h is not "local")

So if my file structure looks like:
rootsroot
+ root
- + src
-- + x
--- + x.h
--- + x.cc
-- + y
--- + y.h

To compile x.cc, if my current directory is rootsroot:
$ g++ -Iroot -c root/src/x/x.cc
should work

To compile x.cc, if my current directory is rootsroot/root:
$ g++ -I$(pwd) -c root/src/x/x.cc
should work

To compile x.cc, if my current directory is rootsroot/root/x:
$ g++ -I$../ -c root/src/x/x.cc
should work

you get the idea
